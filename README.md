Unfortunately I was unable to figure out the process of sending the data from the form to the database. I have no experience with databases or back end web development, so this was a completely new subject for me. I am however very eager to learn more. My week spent on this task was spit up by full-time work at my job, aswell as having to spend a good portion of my time trying to understand the process, and I have ultimately failed at accomplishing the task provided by the brief, but I hope the progress I made on the front end of the website shows promise enough to earn an interview. Many thanks for this opportunity.
